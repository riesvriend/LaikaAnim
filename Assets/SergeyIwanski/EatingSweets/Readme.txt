The asset consists of the most delicious models with different states of eating.
Each object has 5 states from the whole[100%] to the core[20%].
All models are in the "Prefabs" folder, and are already configured;
all you have to do is adjust the "percentage" parameter in the VariousStates component.

You can see the asset capabilities by running the "Demo" scene from the "Scenes" folder.
The _Utils folder contains a items necessary for the work of some functions of an asset, 
they are universally used in different projects and assets, therefore they are moved to a separate folder.

VariousStates script is responsible for the eating process. All you need is to set up different states of the object and put them into a single GameObject root, then add the script to it, the script will do the rest: add child objects to the array and calculate the percentage of eating. The script is universal, it can be used, for example, for the level of damage to buildings or the state of health of characters.

The script takes only all the first child objects in the root GameObject, it does not go inside the child objects. This is done on purpose, because objects can be composite, it would be undesirable to separately add their parts to the state array and switch them in turn.

Scaling models made with the size of real-world objects.
Materials have a color maps 2048x2048, normal and roughness maps 1024x1024.
All textures are in PNG format.
Some products have different roughness textures, for example, the jelly at the cake or chocolate icing on a donut have reflections, the biscuit has a matte surface.

Make your players feel hungry! :D
