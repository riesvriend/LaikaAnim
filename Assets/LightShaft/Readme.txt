Hi if you have any doubt or issue you can contact me at email kelvinparkour@gmail.com.
Use the demo scenes to learn all the possibilities of the plugin, i am working on a new documentation the one that was in project is outdated.
The usage of the plugin is simple, you can use a prefab and modify to what you need.

--For low internet connection we recommend use the LOW quality, unity video player dont support the buffering feature yet, when it supports we will implemment for sure.
--If the video that you want to play is a 3D video, you need to enable the virtual reality settings in unity and use the panoramic skybox scene as start read the 3dTutorial readme file.

For webgl take a look at the folder 'Webgl Youtube Player Setup' if you want to host your webgl player system. (I recommend to use your own, if you dont want to use, just use the webgl demo scene as start).
